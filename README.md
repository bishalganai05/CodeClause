# CodeClause Data Science Internship

## Internship Period: August 1, 2023, to August 31, 2023

Welcome to the CodeClause Data Science Internship repository! This repository encapsulates two comprehensive data science projects completed during the internship period. These projects focus on predictive analysis and association rule mining, covering Churn Prediction in the Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression and Market Basket Analysis in Python using the Apriori Algorithm.

### Projects Completed

#### Churn Prediction in the Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

The Churn Prediction project employs Logistic Regression to forecast churn rates in the telecom industry. Leveraging telecom customer data, the project aims to identify influential factors contributing to customer attrition. The predictive model aids in anticipating potential churners, empowering telecom companies to strategize proactive customer retention methods.

- **Code File**: `Churn_Prediction_Telecom_Industry_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`

#### Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm

The Market Basket Analysis project utilizes the Apriori Algorithm to extract association rules from transactional data. This analysis unveils relationships between purchased items, uncovering customer buying patterns crucial for optimizing product placement strategies and targeted marketing campaigns.
